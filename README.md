 Github repository including the Python code for ECh 267 final project from Xuchang Tang

 The two files belong to the two systems considered in this project. 
 
 To run the .py file, simply scroll down to the if __name__ == '__main__': section. You can adjust the parameters such as the cost matrices, ratio_arr for the array of Q ratio values for consideration, number of simulation, and the number of trials for each Q ratio by adjust the "trial" variable.
 
 To run the .ipynb file, simply run each blocks in sequence until you pass the main function and reached the parameter sections. Similarly, you can adjust the parameters and run for results.
